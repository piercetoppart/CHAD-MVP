# Follow-up MVP Integration Ideas

Based on the HTML wireframes, here are upcoming items to integrate:

1. **Contextual Help Tooltips** – Implement the smart tooltip system shown in `wireframeMVP_v01.html` to guide first–time users through job analysis features.
2. **Progressive Feature Unlocking** – Add gamified progress tracking similar to the "Feature Discovery" section so users gradually access proposal generation and client tracker tools.
3. **Drag-and-Drop CSV Upload Polishing** – Enhance the current CSV import with visual drop zones and template download links per the "Smart Data Import" step.
