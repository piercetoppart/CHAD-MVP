Job Description
We‚Äôre looking for a talented, versatile video editor to help us produce both short-form and long-form content for our personal brand, athlete education platform, and pro football development business.

This role involves editing dynamic short-form clips for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, along with longer cinematic videos for YouTube, podcasts, and storytelling features.

‚öΩÔ∏è About Us:
We run SoccerViza, a football career development platform that helps players break into the professional game. We also own a pro club in Romania (Olimpia Satu Mare) and sign players directly from our program.

Our content is raw, honest, and real ‚Äî not polished hype or fluff. We‚Äôre building something that educates, inspires, and tells the truth about what it takes to go pro in football and life.

‚úÖ Requirements:
Proven experience editing both short and long-form content (please attach a portfolio)

Strong understanding of platform trends, pacing, visual storytelling, and editing for retention

Ability to work independently and deliver clean, finished work quickly

Comfortable receiving feedback and iterating based on team direction

üìÖ Next Steps:
We‚Äôll start with a tested 30 second short form project and then move into an ongoing relationship if it‚Äôs a good fit.
We‚Äôll also schedule a video call to align on creative direction and workflow.

We will discuss the role and details over a call.
